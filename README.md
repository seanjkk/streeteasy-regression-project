### Introduction

After the pandemic hit New York City on March of 2021, the housing market saw a huge plunge in rent prices. Since then, rent prices have been surging rapidly surpassing even prepandemic levels. As a student living in the city, navigating the high prices and volatility in the rental market is stressful. In this project, I will use data from StreetEasy to predict the rent prices of Manhattan housing units based on several variables.

### The Dataset

The dataset I will be using is from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/). The file can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zohaib30/streeteasy-dataset).

### Objectives

- Clean and manipulate the data in Python
- Use Scikit-Learn to create a multiple linear regression model and predict rent prices
